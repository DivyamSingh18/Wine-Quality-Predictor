# Wine-Quality-Predictor

- This model predicts the quality of red wine and I created this model after my 1 month training during 3rd year of B.tech. <br>
- I have made this model with RandomForestClassfier Algorithm. <br>
- The model takes the following inputs:
  >Citric Acid <br>
  >Fixed Acidity <br>
  >Total Sulphur Dioxide <br>
  >Volatile Acidity <br>
  >Sulphates <br>
  >Density <br>
  >Alcohol <br>
  
Based on these input values, the model tells whether the wine quality is good or bad.
