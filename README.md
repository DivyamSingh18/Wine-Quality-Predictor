# Wine-Quality-Predictor

- This model predicts the quality of red wine and I created this model after my 1 month training during 3rd year of B.tech. <br>
- The model takes the following inputs:
  >Citric Acid <br>
  >Fixed Acidity <br>
  >Total Sulphur Dioxide <br>
  >Volatile Acidity <br>
  >Sulphates <br>
  >Density <br>
  >Alcohol <br>
 
Based on these input values, the model tells whether the wine quality is good or bad.

- I have also performed feature selection in this model and handled the imbalanced data in data-set.  <br>
- The Model is deployed at  https://wine-quality-prediction-model.herokuapp.com/ <br>
- This is how the web page looks (you can also use the above link to test it out) <br>
- If the link doesnt work or shows error in application it means that I have run out of heroku credits for hosting the web-app.
