# Wine-Quality-Predictor

- This model predicts the quality of red wine and I created this model after my 1 month training during 3rd year of B.tech. <br>
- I have made this model with RandomForestClassfier Algorithm. <br>
- I have also performed feature selection in this model and handled the imbalanced data in data-set.  <br>
- The Model is deployed at  https://wine-quality-prediction-model.herokuapp.com/ <br>

The Kaggle link for the data-set used in this model is: <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;  https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009?select=winequality-red.csv
<hr>
The model takes the following inputs:
>Citric Acid <br>
>Fixed Acidity <br>
>Total Sulphur Dioxide <br>
>Volatile Acidity <br>
>Sulphates <br>
>Density <br>
>Alcohol <br>

Based on these input values, the model tells whether the wine quality is good or bad.
